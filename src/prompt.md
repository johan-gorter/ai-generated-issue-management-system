# sitemap in server.md
provide server.md
Create a sitemap (a description of the folder structure and some main files for our web application) to add to the technical documentation. Specify locations for routes and mongoose models and jest testcases. We use src/server.ts as entry point and public/ for static files to serve.

give me the commands to create the folders mentioned in the sitemap.

Create the content of src/server.ts with authentication, create a placeholder where to add routes later.

Give me the npm and typescript commands needed to initialize our web application. 

Tell me how to start the server and run unit tests. The server should auto reload changes.

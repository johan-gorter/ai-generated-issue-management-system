# User Document for Passport Authentication

In order to use Passport for user authentication, we need to create a User document in our MongoDB database. This document will store the necessary information for each user. Here is a basic structure of a User document:

```javascript
{
    "_id": ObjectId, // A unique identifier generated by MongoDB
    "username": String, // The unique username provided by the user
    "password": String, // The user's password, which should be hashed for security
    "email": String, // The user's email address
    "createdAt": Date, // The date and time when the user account was created
    "updatedAt": Date // The date and time when the user account was last updated
}
```

When a user signs up, we will create a new User document with the provided username and password. The password should be hashed before being stored in the database to ensure security.

When a user tries to log in, Passport will use the username to find the corresponding User document in the database. It will then compare the hashed password stored in the database with the hashed version of the password provided by the user. If they match, the user is authenticated.

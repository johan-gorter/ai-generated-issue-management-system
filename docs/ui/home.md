# Home Screen Requirements

## Overview
The home screen of our application is the first screen that users see when they open the application. It should provide a clear overview of the current issues and allow users to easily navigate to different parts of the application.

## Columns
The home screen should display a table of issues with the following columns:

1. **Issue ID**: A unique identifier for the issue.
2. **Title**: The title of the issue.
3. **Status**: The current status of the issue (e.g., Open, In Progress, Closed).
4. **Created At**: The date and time when the issue was created.
5. **Updated At**: The date and time when the issue was last updated.

## Buttons
The home screen should include the following buttons:

1. **New Issue**: This button should be labeled "New Issue" and should navigate to a screen where users can create a new issue.
2. **Refresh**: This button should be labeled "Refresh" and should refresh the list of issues.
3. **Issue Details**: Each row in the table should have a button labeled "Details" that navigates to a detailed view of the selected issue.

## Additional Information
The home screen should also display the current user's name and a logout button in the top right corner of the screen.
